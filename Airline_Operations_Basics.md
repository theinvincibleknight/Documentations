## Introduction to Airline Operations:

Airline operations are complex, heavily regulated, and severely constrained. In 1947, there was an international conference in Montreal, where aviation leaders gathered and decided to standardize airline operations. Every manual chapter, for example, Chapter 36, must be about landing gear. This is how it was rationalized globally. Laws were created, including maintenance laws, safety laws, pilot regulations, and engineering standards. All of this was formulated in Montreal by a body called ICAO - the **International Civil Aviation Organization**. ICAO is the governing body for civil aviation, much like the United Nations for civil aviation.

Some people even say that while anyone, even God, can make mistakes, Boeing and Airbus cannot—that's how reliable these aircraft are. You have to trust the processes set by these organizations to understand the "magic" of aviation.

The **Schedule Management System** & **Operations Solutions** can assist airlines by automating and integrating key operational functions, which can help improve efficiency and reduce costs.

You might have seen an aircraft standing still many times when you board. However, if you go down to the ground, the one hour of activity, chaos even, takes place when everything comes together. The aircraft is fueled, the aircraft and engine are inspected, the pilot boards the plane, the catering truck provides food, and the toilet cleaning truck takes care of the toilets—all happening in this one hour. After this, the plane is ready for its next flight.

When you see the flight take off, it’s just the aircraft lifting off the ground. After the pilot, it’s the **Movement Manager System** that updates to confirm the aircraft has taken off. This information is tracked using OOOI Times (Out Of On It), which tracks key phases like when the chocks (blocks under the wheels) are removed, and the aircraft is "out" of the gate.

When the pilot is ready to push back on the tractor and removes the chocks, and releases the parking brake, a signal is triggered from the cockpit. This signal goes to a computer located under the aircraft, in the avionics compartment. The **Digital Flight Data Recorder (DFDR)** receives this signal. Through that signal, it is transmitted via the **SITA Link** to the **Aircom** system. The message is then sent to the Movement Manager system to notify that the aircraft has taken off. This is possible because of a switch in the landing gear; when the landing gear hangs beyond a certain angle, the switch gets activated and sends this signal. It’s fascinating how this entire system functions.

### Departments and Systems:

- **Operations Control (OCC/IOCC)** (CAE: **Movement Manager**) (CAE: **Recovery Manager Ops**)
- **Network Planning & Scheduling** (Sabre **Schedule Manager**)
- **Maintenance & Engineering** (AMOS: **MRO**)
- **Flight Dispatch** (CAE: **Flight Plan Manager**)
- **Load Management** (Netline **Load**: Load & Trim)
- **Crew Management** (CAE: **Crew Manager**) (CAE: **Crew Planner**) (CAE: **Crew Recovery Manager Crew**)
- **Revenue Management** (Vendor/In-house: **Revenue Manager**)

These departments have been running long before computer systems were introduced. Over time, applications were developed to support their functions.

### How do these departments work?

- **Network Planning & Scheduling:** This is run by **Sabre Schedule Manager**. It optimizes schedules for better aircraft utilization.

Let's say we have started a new airline with $10 million in funding and 10 aircraft. Each aircraft costs $600 million, and we’ve already spent all the money as a down payment. These planes cannot sit idle on the ground. They need to be in the sky, or else we won’t earn any money. This is why aircraft utilization is the most important Key Performance Indicator (KPI). How does the system work? It's quite simple, similar to what American Airlines did 20 years ago. They planned a route from Dallas to New York that took 3 hours, with 1 hour of ground time, then back in 3 hours, followed by another hour of ground time before heading to Los Angeles. This is the foundation of network planning. 

However, network planning also involves profit analysis, identifying the exact routes the aircraft should fly. With the **Sabre Schedule Manager**, the system builds the schedule for all 10 aircraft. The system operates on a philosophy that focuses only on the aircraft and sub-fleet; it doesn’t consider anything else. This is where the **Movement Manager** comes in. While **Schedule Manager** is responsible for setting the schedule, the **Movement Manager** is responsible for assigning the actual physical aircraft to operate that schedule. Even though there are 10 aircraft, a specific one must be selected for each flight.

Once the signal comes in, and **Movement Manager** takes over operations control, the first thing it does is a tail assignment. For all the flights the **Schedule Manager** provides, **Movement Manager** assigns an aircraft to each. This is how, when you arrive at the airport, you see the aircraft ready to operate.

**Schedule Manager** is the master of scheduling within an airline. However, with an operations window of 72 hours (3 days), the ownership of the schedule shifts from **Schedule Manager** to **Movement Manager**. Within this 3-day window, **Movement Manager** makes decisions about which aircraft will go where, based on factors such as operational constraints, issues, breakdowns, engineering problems, etc. This shift in ownership of the schedule is what ultimately determines whether an airline is considered "connected" or not, in terms of its ability to manage disruptions and maintain operations smoothly.

---

- **Movement Manager System/OCC:** This is run by **CAE: Movement Manager**. It optimizes aircraft utilization, increases on-time performance, improves dispatch reliability, and carries the commercial responsibility of operations.

Let’s say your aircraft utilization is 14 hours, which is quite good. One reason this is achievable is that the aircraft are new, so breakdowns are minimal, and the reliability and integrity of flights are maintained due to high dispatch reliability.

**Schedule Manager** continuously sends schedules to **Movement Manager**, but **Movement Manager** must check for potential issues. For instance, it must ensure that the fuel is available, whether passengers can be transferred between terminals, or if any changes are needed at the gate. For example, the **Movement Manager** might say, "Change the gate from 53 to 56." The ground crew must then bring the pushback tractor, assemble a team, push the aircraft, and transfer passengers to the new gate.

**Movement Manager** not only focuses on airport utilization but also plays a key role in on-time performance. Why is on-time performance important? It’s not just for passenger satisfaction but also for the airline’s bottom line. Research has shown that "if an aircraft is delayed by just 1 minute, it costs the airline $100." This amount adds up significantly over the course of a year, resulting in substantial losses.

A study was conducted to analyze how many inputs and outputs come into the **Movement Manager** system. It was found that the Movement Manager receives flight plans, passenger boarding numbers, and fuel data, but there was a gap in engineering information, which the **Ops controllers** had to manually input.

The **Ops Controller** doesn’t directly operate the aircraft; instead, they focus on managing the incoming data from various systems. Their goal is simple: how can they get the aircraft on time? If an incoming aircraft is delayed, the **Ops Controller** may need to hold another aircraft on the ground until the delayed one arrives, in order to deal with connecting passengers. They are constantly adjusting aircraft assignments, swapping flights, and making decisions to minimize delays. This is why we say that the **Ops Controller** wears the "commercial hat" of operations, balancing the airline's operational and financial needs.

- **Maintenance & Engineering:** This department uses **AMOS: MRO** (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) to ensure aircraft are safe to fly and always regulatory compliant. It also improves dispatch reliability, aircraft availability, and maintenance yield.

Every time a plane lands, it "dies" — meaning it requires inspection before it can return to service. This inspection is known as the **Arrival/Departure Check**. On the ground, these checks are often referred to as **"Tel-Paani checks"**. After flying over a set number of hours (typically around 1,000 hours), an aircraft is grounded for a maintenance check. Even if the aircraft seems fine, it cannot be flown if the maintenance check has expired — it’s illegal, and you could face serious consequences, including jail time.

This information drives the **Operations Controller** to manage aircraft swapping. For example, if a maintenance check costs a significant amount of money (e.g., ₹50 Lakhs), and an aircraft has completed 1,000 hours of flying, the airline wants to maximize its utilization before the check. If the aircraft is sent to an outstation, it cannot fly back until the check is completed, but hangar space may be limited. So, the **Ops Controller** must plan and schedule maintenance carefully to avoid wasting time and money.

Around 15 years ago, some innovative people at Sabre developed a system that integrated into **Movement Manager**, displaying an indicator showing how many hours were left before an aircraft needed its next maintenance check. This allowed the **Ops Controller** to plan flights more efficiently, ensuring that the aircraft would be flown until the maintenance window, with as few remaining hours as possible, thus maximizing maintenance yield.

The **AMOS** system ensures no checks are missed, and every hour of an aircraft’s operational life is optimized. This helps improve dispatch reliability, aircraft availability, and maintenance yield. 

- **Maintenance Yield** refers to the optimal use of the aircraft’s flying hours before maintenance is required.
- **Dispatch Reliability** is a key term used for on-time performance without engineering defects.
- **Aircraft Availability** is an important KPI; ideally, no more than 20% of an airline’s fleet should be grounded for maintenance at any given time. If maintenance delays drag on and a significant portion of the fleet is grounded, the airline loses revenue, as commercial teams cannot make money from planes that are out of service.

By tracking these KPIs, **Ops Controllers** provide valuable data to leadership, allowing them to track fleet availability and maintenance performance.

- **Flight Dispatch:** This is managed by **CAE: Flight Plan Manager**. This system creates optimized flight plans that reduce fuel costs and other flight-related expenses.

For any flight, a pilot requires a flight plan. Aircraft don’t fly in a straight line — they follow a planned route. This is especially important because, on Earth, only 28% of the surface is land, and the rest is water. Aircraft are not permitted to fly too far from land. International regulations state that if one engine fails, the aircraft must be able to reach an alternate airport within a certain time frame (typically 90 minutes). Therefore, aircraft must always stay within 90 minutes of a diversionary airport.

The second crucial factor in flight planning is navigation. Ground-based **VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range)** and **DME (Distance Measuring Equipment)** stations emit signals that are received by the aircraft's **FMC (Flight Management Computer)**. These signals help pilots navigate using waypoints, defined by latitude and longitude, as they fly across these ground stations.

The two most expensive elements in the aviation industry are crew and fuel. The **Flight Plan Manager** creates the most optimized flight plan by calculating the cheapest route, factoring in not only fuel costs but also other fees such as overflying charges, airport charges, and parking fees. By using a complex algorithm, it helps airlines choose the most cost-effective route from point A to point B.

- **Load Management:** **Netline Load- Load & Trim** is responsible for informing flight crews about an aircraft's takeoff weight, the center of gravity position, and the required stabilizer trim setting. An incorrectly trimmed aircraft could be too nose-heavy or tail-heavy, posing significant risks during takeoff and landing.

If you observe an aircraft, the jet bridge is always connected to the left side of the plane, but never the right side. That’s because the cargo door is on the left side. The loading process starts with the front cargo hold, followed by the rear cargo hold, and then the bulk cargo hold. Proper load distribution is crucial for maintaining the correct **center of gravity**.

The **center of gravity** in a load and trim sheet is calculated based on how much weight is in the front cargo hold versus the rear. The pilot receives this load and trim data, consults a manual chart, and sets the aircraft's horizontal stabilizer based on the aircraft’s center of gravity. If this is wrong, it can lead to a dangerous situation, possibly even a crash.

That’s why **Load Management** is critical — it ensures the correct weight distribution and that the aircraft is balanced properly for takeoff and landing. Every day, it gives accurate counts on how the cargo is loaded, and this information is essential for the safe operation of the aircraft. **Netline Load** plays a key role in ensuring the aircraft’s safety, as well as the safety of passengers and crew.

- **Crew Management:** The **CAE: Crew Manager** system increases crew productivity, ensures regulatory compliance, drives roster fairness, and improves crew lifestyle.

This system is critical as it manages the entire crew scheduling process. As with most systems, it begins to behave like the people it manages. For example, while everyone might want to be a pilot, it’s also one of the toughest jobs in the industry, governed by strict rules. **Crew Management** starts with **planning**: one month in advance, the schedule is built to create **pairings**.

A **pairing** is essentially a schedule that defines the crew members who will fly an aircraft on a specific route. For instance, if a plane travels from **BOM** (Mumbai) to **DEL** (Delhi) to **LON** (London) and back in one day, the crew cannot fly the entire route without breaks, as they are governed by **rest rules**. The system assigns the crew flying from **BOM** to **DEL** will rest in **DEL**, and a different set of crew will fly the aircraft to **LON**. This is how **pairings** are made.

A pairing becomes a **roster** when the specific crew members are assigned to it. A pairing contains details such as the required crew members — one captain, one first officer, flight attendants, etc. It also includes logistics like hotel bookings, catering arrangements, and more. Once a name is assigned to the crew for the pairing, it becomes a roster.

The system then feeds this pairing data into a **roster optimizer**, which processes the assignments based on several factors, such as the crew's current leave status, training schedules, and medical eligibility to fly. After the optimizer runs, the resulting roster shows which crew will fly which flights. 

This entire process is quite complex. The **Crew Manager** system ensures **crew productivity** by limiting the number of hours each crew member can fly annually — typically 800-1,000 hours. With a fleet of 5,000 crew members and 500 flights per day, the system ensures that all crew members fly their allotted hours while avoiding exceeding legal limits. Even a small improvement in productivity can lead to significant profits.

Another critical aspect is **roster fairness**. The system ensures no crew member is overburdened. For example, if **New York** is a prime station, the system will avoid repeatedly sending the same crew to fly there. Instead, it will rotate the assignments to ensure fairness, following rules set by the **unions** and **companies**. By doing so, the **Crew Manager** system keeps the roster balanced, compliant with regulations, and increases operational efficiency.

One of the biggest challenges the airline industry faces is **disruptions** — such as storms, heavy rain, or snowstorms — which can cause a large number of flights to be canceled. For example, after a **snowstorm**, when airports are frozen, all crews may have exhausted their duty limits, and flights cannot be operated because pilots and crew members are no longer legally allowed to fly. This situation creates chaos with thousands of passengers stranded at airports.

The recovery process is crucial. It starts by recovering flights, but it also requires the **recovery of crew** within legal limits, with proper rest and licenses. **CAE: Recovery Manager Crew** is used in these situations. This system helps restore flight operations by ensuring the crew is legally fit to fly and that flights are re-scheduled appropriately. Recovery is a complex task, as it involves not just aircraft but also managing the crew's rest and legal limits. This is a massive undertaking for **Operations Controllers**, as they must coordinate all logistics and get planes back on schedule. While passengers may think this process is simple, it actually costs airlines millions of dollars to coordinate such recovery efforts.

- **Revenue Management:** The **Revenue Manager** forecasts demand, manages inventory, and responds to competitors’ pricing in the market.

The concept of **Revenue Management** was pioneered by **Dr. Peter Belobaba**, who is often referred to as the “father of revenue management.” He worked as a consultant for **Sabre** and built the first **revenue management system** for **American Airlines** in the 1970s and 80s. His work laid the foundation for what is now a sophisticated system used by airlines worldwide.

Revenue management can be thought of as **legal “black marketing.”** In the early days of cinema, tickets were sold at inflated prices by resellers. Similarly, in the airline industry, **Revenue Management** involves strategically pricing tickets in a way that maximizes revenue without violating any laws. In the 1970s, two U.S. Senators filed a lawsuit accusing airlines of black marketing their tickets. The airlines defended themselves with an argument that Dr. Belobaba provided: Black marketing involves selling the same service for a higher price, whereas **Revenue Management** allows airlines to provide different ticket prices depending on when customers book. For example, a passenger who books a flight 2 days in advance is not the same as one who books 15 days in advance. The latter has more time to decide, and they should pay a higher price for the convenience.

Thus, the court ruled in favor of the airlines, and **Revenue Management** became a legitimate practice.

Revenue management systems work by maximizing profits through dynamic pricing. For instance, if you sell all tickets at 5,000 rupees, and if all tickets are sold at this price, the airline will make a fixed amount of money. But if the airline sells seats at different price points — offering cheaper tickets (e.g., ₹2000) well in advance and charging higher prices as the flight date nears — they can increase overall revenue.

In the past, the system was rudimentary. Today, **Revenue Management** uses sophisticated models that take into account demand forecasts, market dynamics, load factors, and pricing strategies across different regions. This complex system allows airlines to predict demand and optimize pricing, ensuring maximum revenue from every flight.

### Summary:

The **airline operations** process is a highly integrated ecosystem where various departments and systems collaborate to ensure the airline runs efficiently, safely, and profitably. Each department leverages advanced systems to tackle its specific set of challenges while contributing to overall operational success. Here's a breakdown of each department involved:

1. **Operations Control (OCC/IOCC)**:
   - Managed by **CAE: Movement Manager** and **CAE: Recovery Manager Ops**, the Operations Control center ensures that flights operate on time and disruptions are effectively managed. The **Movement Manager** optimizes aircraft utilization and on-time performance by managing the scheduling and movement of aircraft in real-time. When disruptions such as weather events or technical issues occur, the **Recovery Manager Ops** system helps restore the operation by recovering flights and ensuring crew legality, rest, and compliance during recovery, helping minimize the operational downtime.

2. **Network Planning & Scheduling**:
   - Powered by **Sabre Schedule Manager**, this department handles the overall scheduling of flights, ensuring optimal aircraft utilization and efficiency. The scheduling process accounts for various factors like route profitability, aircraft turnaround times, and operational constraints. The **Schedule Manager** ensures that each aircraft is deployed effectively to maximize the airline's financial performance while maintaining consistent, reliable services.

3. **Maintenance & Engineering**:
   - **AMOS MRO** ensures that all aircraft undergo the necessary inspections and maintenance checks. The system helps track and manage aircraft availability, dispatch reliability, and maintenance yield. By optimizing maintenance schedules, it minimizes downtime and maximizes aircraft usage while ensuring regulatory compliance and safety. Accurate tracking of hours and scheduled maintenance ensures operational readiness and prevents costly delays.

4. **Flight Dispatch**:
   - **CAE: Flight Plan Manager** optimizes the flight planning process by considering fuel consumption, route efficiency, and overflying charges. The flight plan system ensures that aircraft take the most cost-effective route, reducing operational costs and increasing profitability. This system accounts for factors like weather, airspace congestion, and alternate airports to ensure smooth operations and compliance with international aviation regulations.

5. **Load Management**:
   - Managed by **Netline Load: Load & Trim**, this system ensures the correct loading of aircraft to achieve safe takeoff, landing, and stable flight conditions.
